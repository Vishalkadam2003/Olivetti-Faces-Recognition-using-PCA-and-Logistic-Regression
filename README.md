# Olivetti-Faces-Recognition-using-PCA-and-Logistic-Regression
This project demonstrates face recognition on the classic [Olivetti Faces dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#olivetti-faces) using:

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and visualization of eigenfaces.
- Logistic Regression** classifier to predict the identities of faces.

 Features
- Load and preprocess face image data.
- Reduce high-dimensional pixel data to principal components (eigenfaces).
- Train a logistic regression model for classification.
- Visualize the top 25 eigenfaces.
- Evaluate model accuracy.

 Dependencies
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

Install them via pip if needed:
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
